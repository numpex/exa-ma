# Feel++ Package

## Description

Feel++ is an open-source, high-performance C++ framework for solving complex PDE and ODE-based mathematical models using advanced Galerkin methods (finite element, discontinuous Galerkin, and spectral methods) and efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) techniques, including Reduced Basis (RB), Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and Empirical Interpolation Methods (EIM). It features specialized application toolboxes (CFD, CSM, FSI, thermoelectric, Maxwell), modern parallel computing with seamless Python integration (Pybind11), and extensive DevOps support (CI/CD, benchmarking, and containers). Feel++ is used in academia and industry for multiphysics simulations, inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, data assimilation, and machine learning applications.
