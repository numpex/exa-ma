== Objectives

WP3 aims to design numerical kernels for solving linear systems that are mostly agnostic of the underlying models and approximation techniques:

* Generic solution techniques that don't depend on function representation
* Reduction of computational complexity, memory footprint, and data movement
* Communication avoiding/hiding strategies with mixed arithmetic and data compression
* Exploitation of extreme parallelism for coupled physics solvers
