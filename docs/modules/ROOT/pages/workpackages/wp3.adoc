WP3 designs scalable solvers for sparse linear systems and coupled multiphysics, tuned for exascale architectures.

== Objectives
- Domain decomposition and multilevel preconditioners
- Mixed-precision and error-controlled solvers
- Adaptive strategies for coupled multiphysics

== Leads & Timeline
- Lead: Inria
- Duration: Months 1-60

== Recent Highlights
- GenEO preconditioner delivering up to 50x speedup on large Cobra cavity cases (45M DoFs, 2916 cores)
- Robust multiphysics coupling strategies validated with WP1 meshes and WP6 UQ cases
- Solver kernels prepared for heterogeneous GPU/CPU targets

== Next Steps
- Extend GenEO scaling studies to additional EuroHPC systems
- Integrate mixed-precision pathways into WP7 benchmarking
- Publish solver playbooks for application teams
