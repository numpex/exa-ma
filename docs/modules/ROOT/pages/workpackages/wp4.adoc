WP4 merges observational data with physics-based models to improve predictions and decision making.

== Objectives
- Variational and ensemble-based data assimilation
- Stochastic modeling (SDEs/SPDEs) and multi-fidelity strategies
- Optimized observation error models for high-dimensional problems

== Leads & Timeline
- Lead: Université de Strasbourg
- Duration: Months 1-60

== Recent Highlights
- Demonstrated scalable assimilation workflows on EuroHPC targets
- Improved error models feeding downstream UQ and optimization tasks
- Prepared benchmarks to couple with WP3 solvers and WP6 UQ cases

== Next Steps
- Add reproducible assimilation pipelines to the showroom
- Tighten integration with WP6 sensitivity analyses
- Document best practices for heterogeneous observation data
