WP1 develops robust mesh generation, adaptive refinement, and high-order discretizations that minimize communication and exploit exascale hardware.

== Objectives
- Reliable meshing from imperfect or CAD-heavy geometries
- Adaptive mesh refinement and anisotropy at scale
- High-order and spectral discretizations
- Parallel and asynchronous time integration

== Leads & Timeline
- Lead: CEA
- Duration: Months 1-60

== Recent Highlights
- Feature-preserving alpha wrapping integrated in CGAL 6.0
- Ktirio-geom pipeline for city-scale watertight meshes deployed on EuroHPC systems
- Thermal-bridge and ParMMG benchmarks validating large-scale adaptivity

== Next Steps
- Broaden urban meshing benchmarks across additional EuroHPC sites
- Integrate meshing outputs into WP3 solver pipelines
- Publish reproducible meshing recipes in the showroom
