== Objectives

The key objectives are twofold:

[discrete]
=== Geometric Domain Representations
**Meshes** are the main starting point for simulations. WP1 develops adaptive, multiresolution, robust-to-defects, and efficient parallel representations of large-scale models supporting:

* Valid large-scale mesh generation from CAD or measurement data
* Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for structured/unstructured grids
* Nonconforming methods for parallel efficiency
* All-hexahedral block grids for high-order methods

[discrete]
=== Physics-Based Models
**Multiphysics coupling** at multiple scales in space and time requires:

* High-order methods to increase computational intensity and reduce communications
* Nonconforming methods designed to avoid/reduce/minimize communications
* Parallel-in-time strategies for evolution equations
* Adaptive coupling techniques for multiphysics/multiscale problems
