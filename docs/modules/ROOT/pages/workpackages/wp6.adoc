WP6 quantifies uncertainties in complex multiscale simulations and propagates them through the prediction pipeline.

== Objectives
- Kernel-based sensitivity analysis
- Surrogate modeling for UQ and high-dimensional integration
- Multi-arithmetic and multi-fidelity approaches

== Leads & Timeline
- Lead: École Polytechnique
- Duration: Months 1-60

== Recent Highlights
- Sensitivity analyses linked with WP3 solvers and WP2 surrogates
- Initial UQ pipelines exercised on EuroHPC resources
- Shared UQ components prepared for WP7 benchmarking

== Next Steps
- Expand UQ benchmarks with additional industrial test cases
- Provide ready-to-run sensitivity examples in the showroom
- Align UQ metrics with WP0 reporting for impact tracking
