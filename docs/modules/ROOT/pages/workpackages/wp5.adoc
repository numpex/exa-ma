WP5 advances exascale-ready optimization methods for continuous, combinatorial, and mixed problems, including AI-driven pipelines.

== Objectives
- Decomposition-based and surrogate-assisted optimization
- Shape and topology optimization at scale
- Optimization for AI (AutoML) and hybrid workflows

== Leads & Timeline
- Lead: Inria
- Duration: Months 1-60

== Recent Highlights
- Bayesian optimization at scale, exercised on 8000 GPUs (LUMI) with fractal decomposition
- Surrogate-based workflows coupled with WP2 ML models and WP6 UQ
- Early AutoML experiments on HPC software parameter tuning

== Next Steps
- Broaden large-scale Bayesian optimization benchmarks
- Integrate optimization loops with WP7 CI/CD runners
- Publish reproducible optimization notebooks and parameter studies
