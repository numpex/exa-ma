== Objectives

WP2 uses **non-intrusive** approaches for designing ultra-fast surrogate models and strategies for leveraging these surrogates:

[discrete]
=== Data-Driven Techniques
* Comparisons between reduced basis methods and neural network-based methods
* Deep learning operators (FNO, DeepONet) for PDE solutions
* Data-driven model order reduction without intrusive access to simulators

[discrete]
=== Model-Driven Techniques
* Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) respecting conservation laws
* Neural operators learning PDE operators from data
* Hybrid approaches combining physical constraints with data
