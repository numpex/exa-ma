WP2 accelerates simulations using reduced-order models and data-driven surrogates that remain faithful to physics.

== Objectives
- Neural Galerkin and physics-informed neural networks
- Non-intrusive reduced basis and multi-fidelity surrogates
- Hybrid data- and physics-driven approaches for complex PDEs

== Leads & Timeline
- Lead: Inria
- Duration: Months 1-60

== Recent Highlights
- Domain-decomposed PINNs with perfectly matched layers for high-dimensional advection-diffusion
- Neural operators (FNO) accelerating Newton solvers by 80-200% CPU savings
- Mesh-adaptation and preconditioning gains through ML-guided models

== Next Steps
- Expand PINN benchmarks to larger geometries from WP1
- Package surrogate models for WP7 CI/CD benches
- Publish reference notebooks in the showroom
