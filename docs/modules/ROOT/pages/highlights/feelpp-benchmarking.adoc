== Context and Objective

HPC applications require *reproducibility, portability, and large-scale testing*, but the path from code to supercomputer remains long and heterogeneous across sites.

*Objective*: Unify the Exa-MA application framework and automate build, tests, and deployments in compliance with *NumPEx guidelines*.

* Code → large-scale execution: *days → < 24h*
* *Zero manual intervention* on target site
* Automated non-regression tests (strong/weak scaling)
* Future: profiling artifacts
____
====

*Pipeline*: GitHub Actions → Reframe/SLURM submission → French & EuroHPC supercomputers

== Benchmarking Platform

The platform provides three main entry points for exploring benchmark results: *Applications*, *Supercomputers*, and *Use Cases*.

== Multi-Site Deployment

Benchmarks are automatically deployed across multiple EuroHPC and national HPC centers: Discoverer (Sofia), Gaya (Strasbourg), Karolina (Ostrava), LUMI (Kajaani), MeluXina (Bissen), and more.

.Auto-generated page providing access to benchmark reports by machine
image::highlights/feelpp-benchmarking/2-automated-views-per-machine.jpg[Machine Views,600]

*Hundreds of benchmarks* deployed automatically with performance tracking across all sites.
