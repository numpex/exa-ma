== Technical Details

=== Problem Characteristics
* *Application*: Cobra cavity industrial benchmark
* *Problem Size*: 45 million degrees of freedom (DoFs)
* *Computing Resources*: 2,916 CPU cores
* *Method*: GenEO (Generalized Eigenvalue in Overlapping domains) preconditioning

=== Performance Metrics
* *Baseline*: Standard domain decomposition methods
* *Optimized*: GenEO-enhanced solver pipeline
* *Speedup*: Up to 50× reduction in solution time
* *Scalability*: Strong scaling maintained across thousands of cores

== Method Innovation

The GenEO preconditioner enhances classical domain decomposition by:

1. **Adaptive Coarse Space Construction**: Automatically builds coarse spaces based on local eigenvalue problems
2. **Robust Convergence**: Maintains iteration counts independent of problem parameters
3. **Parallel Efficiency**: Scales effectively to thousands of cores
4. **Mixed-Precision Support**: Additional gains through adaptive precision strategies

== Impact on Applications

This breakthrough enables:

* *Industrial Simulations*: Complex geometries (aerospace, automotive) now tractable at full resolution
* *Real-Time Analysis*: Faster turnaround for design optimization loops
* *Larger Problems*: Previously infeasible problem sizes now accessible
* *Energy Efficiency*: Reduced computational time = lower energy consumption
