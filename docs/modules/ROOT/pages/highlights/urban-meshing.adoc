== Technical Details

=== CGAL 6.0 Integration
* *Alpha Wrapping*: Robust watertight surface extraction from imperfect inputs
* *Feature Preservation*: Sharp edges and corners maintained during wrapping
* *Scalability*: Handles city-scale geometries (thousands of buildings)
* *Quality Guarantees*: Provable geometric and topological properties

=== Ktirio-geom Pipeline
* *Input*: Raw urban data (building footprints, LiDAR, OpenStreetMap)
* *Processing*: Geometric cleaning, feature detection, adaptive wrapping
* *Output*: Simulation-ready volumetric meshes
* *Deployment*: EuroHPC systems (Joliot-Curie, MareNostrum)

== Algorithmic Innovation

The alpha wrapping approach:

1. **Offset Surface Construction**: Create offset of input geometry at scale α
2. **Feature Detection**: Identify and protect geometric features
3. **Watertight Extraction**: Guarantee closed, manifold output mesh
4. **Quality Optimization**: Post-processing for simulation requirements

### Advantages Over Traditional Methods
* *Robustness*: Handles degenerate, intersecting, or incomplete input
* *Automation*: Minimal manual intervention required
* *Performance*: Parallel implementation for large-scale datasets
* *Provable Quality*: Theoretical guarantees on output topology

== Application: Urban Energy Simulation

The pipeline enables:

* **Building Energy Models**: Thermal comfort, HVAC optimization
* **Microclimate Simulation**: Urban heat island effects, wind patterns
* **Solar Potential**: Rooftop solar panel placement optimization
* **Digital Twins**: Real-time city monitoring and scenario planning

### Case Studies
* *Paris City Center*: 5,000+ buildings meshed for thermal analysis
* *Mediterranean Coastal City*: Wind and thermal coupling for urban planning
* *Smart City Initiative*: Integration with sensor networks for validation

== EuroHPC Deployment

Successfully deployed on:

* **Jean Zay (IDRIS)**: Large-scale pre-processing workflows
* **Joliot-Curie (TGCC)**: Coupled meshing + simulation pipelines
* **MareNostrum (BSC)**: Multi-city comparative studies

### Performance Metrics
* *Throughput*: 1,000+ buildings per hour on 100 cores
* *Scalability*: Linear weak scaling to 1,000+ cores
* *Memory Efficiency*: Streaming algorithms for TB-scale datasets

== Impact on Urban Science

This capability transforms:

* **Policy Making**: Evidence-based urban planning decisions
* **Climate Adaptation**: Assess heat mitigation strategies before deployment
* **Energy Transition**: Optimize renewable energy integration in cities
* **Disaster Preparedness**: Flood, fire, and earthquake scenario modeling
